# ourWayUp
Here lies the Foundation for the Future we built ourselves.

**Language:** C++  
**Application Type:** Game Development  
**Genre:** RPG  
**Collaborators:** BRUH & BUFU  

## Project Overview
ourWayUp is a collaborative RPG project designed to explore immersive gameplay using the power of Unreal Engine 5. We aim to create an engaging experience that combines complex mechanics, detailed worlds, and a rich narrative.

## Learning Resources
To ensure a strong foundation in game development, we are utilizing the [Unreal Engine 5: The Ultimate Game Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/learn/lecture/32523128?start=405#overview). This course helps us expand our understanding of:
- Setting up Unreal Engine 5 effectively
- Building assets and environments
- Coding game logic with C++ and Blueprints
- Implementing physics and mechanics

The knowledge gained from this course supports the technical and creative aspects of our project.

## Technologies
- **Unreal Engine 5:** The core engine for creating our game world
- **C++:** Our primary programming language for systems and gameplay
- **Blueprints:** A visual scripting tool within UE5 to streamline development

## Development Goals
Moving forward, our focus is on integrating more advanced elements such as:
- Expansive environments
- AI-driven NPC behavior

Updates on our progress will follow as we continue to refine and expand the game.
