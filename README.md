## Project Overview
ourWayUp is a collaborative project aiming to create an immersive RPG experience using C++ and Unreal Engine 5. Our goal is to push the boundaries of game development by incorporating cutting-edge technologies and design principles.

## Learning and Development
To ensure the highest quality for our project, we are leveraging top-tier learning resources, including the [Unreal Engine 5: The Ultimate Game Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/learn/lecture/32523128?start=405#overview) on Udemy.

This course is instrumental in helping us master key aspects of Unreal Engine 5, including:
- Setting up the UE5 environment
- Creating game assets and dynamic worlds
- Implementing complex mechanics and physics
- Utilizing Blueprints and C++ for game logic

We are continuously enhancing our skills through this curriculum, ensuring that our project reflects the latest advancements in game design and development.

## Technologies Used
- **Unreal Engine 5:** For game engine and development environment
- **C++:** For game logic and system programming
- **Blueprints:** Visual scripting within Unreal Engine for rapid development

## Future Goals
As we progress through development, we aim to integrate:
- Dynamic open-world elements
- Sophisticated AI for NPCs
- Multiplayer functionalities

Stay tuned for updates as we move forward on our journey to build the future of gaming!
